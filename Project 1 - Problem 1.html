    <h1>Problem 1 introduction</h1>
    <p>
        The problem we solved is perhaps best known as the secretary problem. Assume that there is a company looking for
        a new employee. What is the probability of choosing the best candidate among a set of applicants? If one assumes
        that the order of the candidates is entirely random and that once a person is rejected, he or she is rejected
        for ever, it can be shown that there is a strategy that will choose surprisingly often the best candidate --
        or at least one of the top three candidates.
    </p>
    Briefly, the strategy is to discard the k first candidates, find the best candidate among the k rejected
    candidates, x*, and choose the first person after the kth canddate that is better than x*.
    <h2>Problem 1 a)</h2>
    <p>
        A strategy one can use to obtain P(Z = 1), the probability of picking the best candidate, is to condition on
        another random variable Y, where Y denotes the event that the best candidate will be the <i>i</i>th candidate in the
        process. By using marginalization over Y, equation (1) is obtained.
    </p>
    <p>
        Using the proposed strategy, P(Z = 1|Y = <i>i</i>) will be 0 for all <i>i</i> less than <i>k</i> + 1, which
        is the cut-off value. The reason for this is that P(Z = 1|Y = <i>i</i>) is the probability that
        the strategy will pick the best candidate when the position of the candidate is known to be <i>i</i>. However,
        the strategy will never pick the right candidate as long as the best candidate is among the <i>k</i> candidates
        rejected. Therefore, the probability is P(Z = 1|Y = <i>i</i>) is 0 for all <i>i</i> less than
        <i>i</i> less than <i>k</i> + 1.
    </p>
    <p>
        Now, in order for the strategy to be able to pick the best candidate, the best candidate among the <i>i</i> -
        1 first candidates must be among the k rejected. Seeing that this candidate can be located anywhere among the
        <i>k</i> candidates, <i>k</i>/(<i>i</i> - 1) is obtained.
    </p>
    <p>
        By noting that the best candidate is uniformly distributed among the total of <i>n</i> candidates,
        one can see that P(Y = <i>i</i>) equals 1/<i>n</i>. Thus, equation (2) has been obtained. By using known rules
        of sums, <k>k</k> and 1/<i>n</i> can be extracted by the sum, the result of which is equation (3).
    </p>
    <p>
        Equation (3) will be less than or equal to the integral found in equation (4), which equals equation (5).
    </p>
    <p>
        With the result found in equation and (5), the desired result has been proven.
    </p>
    <h2>Problem 1 b)</h2>
    <p>Compute mode here. </p>
    <p>
        Let us differentiate the result we found in equation (5).
    </p>
    <p>Insert plot for n = 30 here.</p>
    <p>
        By studying the plots generated by fixing n to 30, it becomes clear that the probability of choosing
        the best candidate grows as k approaches 11. After k = 11, the probability of choosing the best candidate goes
        down. In other words, This result corresponds nicely to what was found earlier, namely that the ideal value of k is n/e.
    </p>
    <p>Insert plot for n = 40 here.</p>
    <p>
        Analogously, a similar pattern emerges when n is fixed to 40. The probability of choosing
        the best candidate grows as k approaches 12. Once again, the best value of k seems to be in the vicinity of n/e.
    </p>
    <p>
        The interpretation of this result seems to be that probability of picking the best candidate grows as one increases the number of candidates
        rejected. However, this tendency applies until k reaches its zenith at around the value of n/e. Note that this was
        the value that was ascertained to be the analytically optimal value for k.
    </p>
    <p>
        How did we arrive at the results?
    </p>

    <h2>Problem 1 c)</h2>
    <p>
        For this task, the value of n was fixed to 30, whereas the value of k was fixed to n/e, the analytically optimal
        value for k found in Problem 1 b). To explore how the strategy fared in practice, the strategy was run on a
        simulation a thousand times. The simulation used a random uniformly distributed variable in order to generate
        the various candidate values.
    </p>
    <p>
        The following results were found:
        The strategy was able to find the right candidate 391 times.
        The strategy was in the top three 59.5 % of the time.
        The strategy ended up interviewing all the candidates 40.4 % of the time.
    </p>
    <h2>Problem 1 d)</h2>
    <p>
        In contrast to Problem 1 c), the value of n now considered as a random variable N taking one of the values
        contained in the interval [16,45]. The value of k, which could be any of the values in the interval [1,15], was
        chosen based on the expected value of N.  The expected value of N is 30. Hence, the value of k based on
        30 being the expected of value of N, was chosen to be 11, which is approximately the optimal value 30/e.
        To explore how the strategy fared in practice, as with Problem 1 c), the strategy was run on a
        simulation a thousand times. Once again, the simulation used a random uniformly distributed variable in order to generate
        the various candidate values. However, by contrast to Problem 1 c), the simulations were executed for all values
        of N.
    </p>
    <p>
        These questions will be answered by running the strategy a thousand realizations.
        The strategy was able to find the right candidate 351 times.
        The strategy was in the top three 56.34 % of the time.
        The strategy ended up interviewing all the candidates 43.2 % of the time.
